	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	<p>Matt’s passion for food started at a young age. Having
	  grown up in a family who lived and breathed good food, he
	  developed an infectious enthusiasm for cooking very early
	  on.</p>  
	<p>Matt’s culinary career has seen him work in commercial
	  kitchens in, Austria, Latin America and London, where he
	  worked as the Sous-Chef at the famous Notting Hill eatery,
	  Tacqueria. Upon returning to Sydney, Matt joined the
	  renowned team at Bondi Icebergs Dining Room and Bar; one
	  of Sydney’s most prestigious restaurants, and winner of
	  two chefs hats for six consecutive years. Having honed his
	  chef skills in kitchens around the world, Matt then
	  decided to explore a new passion in catering, where he has
	  since worked with some of Australia’s leading catering
	  companies.</p>
