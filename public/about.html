	<div>Matt’s passion for food started at a young age. Having grown up in a family who lived and breathed good food, he developed an infectious enthusiasm for cooking very early on.  
Matt’s culinary career has seen him work in commercial kitchens in, Austria, Latin America and London, where he worked as the Sous-Chef at the famous Notting Hill eatery, Tacqueria.     
Upon returning to Sydney, Matt joined the renowned team at Bondi Icebergs Dining Room and Bar; one of Sydney’s most prestigious restaurants, and winner of two chefs hats for six consecutive years. 
Having honed his chef skills in kitchens around the world, Matt then decided to explore a new passion in catering, where he has since worked with some of Australia’s leading catering companies.
